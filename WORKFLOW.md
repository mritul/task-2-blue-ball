# WORKFLOW

1. Create player with position and functions to draw the ball and update it
2. Provide gravity and add it to y velocity whenever the ball is not in bottom edge
3. Give controls using arrows using event listeners(keyup and keydown)
4. Handle platform collisions. When ball is on a platform it should not fall
5. Make platforms and ball scroll up by giving them a vertical velocity
